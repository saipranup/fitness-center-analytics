# Fitness Center Analytics Project

This project uses data from a fitness center to analyze member workout behavior, segment users, and predict calorie expenditure. The goal is to improve training effectiveness and personalize fitness recommendations.

---

## Files Included

- `Fitness.csv`: Raw dataset with member demographics and workout metrics
- `Fitness_Center_Code.R`: R script containing data preprocessing, clustering, and regression modeling
- `Fitness_Center_Report.docx`: Final report explaining the analysis process, insights, and business recommendations

---

## Project Objective

To support data-driven decision-making by:
- Segmenting members based on their workout behavior and health indicators
- Predicting calorie expenditure using biometric and session-based variables
- Recommending personalized training plans to improve outcomes

---

## Key Techniques Used

- Data cleaning and transformation
- Feature engineering (e.g., session duration, intensity scores)
- K-Prototypes clustering for segmentation
- Regression analysis for calorie prediction
- Visual insights and business interpretation

---

## Project Outcome

The analysis successfully identified meaningful member clusters and key predictors of calorie burn. These findings can help the fitness center tailor its services, improve engagement, and support member fitness goals.
